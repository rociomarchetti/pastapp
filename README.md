A simple **Angular CLI** application built as part of my frontend portfolio.  
The project demonstrates **clean architecture**, **modular structure**, **reusable UI components**, and **reactive state management with RxJS**.

## üìê Design Decisions & Assumptions  

- **Modular structure**  
  - `core` ‚Üí app-wide singletons (layout, services)  
  - `recipes` ‚Üí feature-based modules with encapsulated UI + logic  
  - `shared` ‚Üí reusable UI and entities  

- **State management**  
  Used `BehaviorSubject` in `RecipeService` instead of a full NgRx setup, since the app is small. This provides a simple but fully reactive state solution.  

- **Persistence**  
  Recipes are stored in `localStorage`. A mock dataset (`RECIPES_MOCK`) is used as the initial data.  

- **Styling**  
  Built mainly with custom **SCSS** styles and some **Angular Material** components for consistency and accessibility.  

- **UI components**  
  Created generic `Card`, `Modal`, and `Button` components in `shared/ui` to ensure design consistency and reusability across features.  

- **Scalability**  
  The feature-based folder structure under `recipes/` makes it easy to extend the application with new modules and UI components in the future.
